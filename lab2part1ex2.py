"""
2. Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to test your class.
 Use integer variables to represent the private data of the class – the numerator and the denominator.
 Provide a __init__() method that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it’s declared.
 The __init__() should contain default parameter values in case no initializers are provided and should store
 the fraction in reduced form. For example, the fraction 2/4 would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator
 and 2 in the denominator. Provide public methods that perform each of the following tasks:
- printing Rational numbers in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator.
- printing Rational numbers in floating-point format.
