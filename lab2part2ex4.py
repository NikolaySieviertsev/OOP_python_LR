Task 4.
Create a class BINARY TREE that contains background information of product prices (product code, price of 1 product).
The tree is sorted by product codes. From the keyboard enter data on the number of products in the format:
product code, number of products. Using a tree, find the cost of products (cost = quantity * price of one product).
